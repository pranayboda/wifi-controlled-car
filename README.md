# WiFi Controlled Car

This project is a WiFi-controlled car using an Arduino microcontroller and ESP8266 WiFi module. The car can be operated remotely using a web interface or a mobile application, with features including direction control, speed adjustment, and obstacle avoidance.

## Features
- Remote operation via web or mobile app
- Real-time control and monitoring
- Obstacle avoidance and autonomous navigation

## Components Used
- Arduino Microcontroller
- ESP8266 WiFi Module
- L298N Motor Driver
- DC Motors
- Ultrasonic and Infrared Sensors

## Getting Started
1. Install the required libraries: `ESP8266WiFi`, `WiFiClient`, `ESP8266WebServer`.
2. Connect the components as per the circuit diagram.
3. Upload the code from `wifi_controlled_car.ino` to your Arduino board.

## How to Use
- Connect to the WiFi network `nodeMCUCar`.
- Open the web interface or mobile app to control the car's movements.
